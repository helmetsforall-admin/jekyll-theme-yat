<p>Hello, Iâ€™m Jenna, a Texas girl scout who is striving to make helmets accessable to everyone. Becuase I found this issue to be important I've made it the subject of my Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award offered in the program.</p> 
<p>Please <a href="mailto:info@helmentsforall.org">contact me</a> if you would like more information about this issue, would like to share your experience, or if you have an idea to help solve this problem.</p>
