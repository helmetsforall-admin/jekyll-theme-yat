## Understanding the Problem
<p>Ethnic hairstyles are widely diverse, but almost all of them share a common problem: Commercial helmets don't fit them properly. This is a huge issue in both inclusivity and in safety. Participating in certain activies without helmets is a huge risk to your health, but for many in historically marginalized communities it's the only option. The problem is simple, helmets for ethnic hair are just not available. For years these communies have used oils, sprays, scarfs, and other means to fit their hair into these helmets. Some even alter the helmets themselves in an attepmt to make them work. No matter what they do none of these solutions are safe or ideal.</p>

<p>The only real solution is to create helmets that work for everyone, but helmet manufactures are hesitent to make a difference. They cite the difficulties in creating and marketing these new helmets. They worry that there will not be enough customers to justify the costs. This being said,  thousands of people are affected by this issue everytime they participate in helmeted activities. This issue affects children in particular, who are much more likely to wear helmets and to sustain head injuries without one.</p>

<p>There is a solution to this issue, but we just have to find it. Working together I know a difference can be made and helmets can become available for everyone.</p>
